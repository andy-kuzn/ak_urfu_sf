### Introduction
The aim of this project is to guess the number 'picked' by the computer in the least possible number of tries.

### General Info
A python program needs to be written that would guess a randomly generated number in as few iterations as possible.

### Contest Rules
- The computer picks a random number from 0 to 100 and we need to guess it. To 'guess' means to write a program that is able to guess the number.
- The algorythm takes into account whether our guess is higher or lower than the picked number.

### Code Metrics
Results are judged based on the average number of tries needed to guess the picked number after 1000 runs of the algorythm.

### Project Outcome
Learning to write high-quality code in Python is the main purpose of this project.
